Nuggeta is a crossplatform, multiplayer and social developement toolkit for game studios. 

<h2>Why integrate Nuggeta in my Google Game Service Project</h2>

If you have already run  samples of Google Game Services, you have probably notice that you have to deal with bytes arrays to send and receive data over Google Game Services. 

This can be very hard to use and maintain in a real game with a lot of different data to exchange.

Fortunately , Nuggeta offer you a powerfull API to deal with your custom objects instead of bytes.


<h2>How to integrate Nuggeta</h2>

Now it's time to see the benefits of Nuggeta.
Let's go to the sample ButtonClicker  and see Nuggeta in action.
